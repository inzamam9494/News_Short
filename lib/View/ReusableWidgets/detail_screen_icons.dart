The central government is using a sensitive state like Uttarakhand for tokenism, if they want to bring UCC, it should have been brought by the central government, he told ANI.It is important to note that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had promised the Uniform Civil Code bill during the 2022 Assembly elections in the state. After becoming a law, the bill will replace the personal religious laws that govern marriage, divorce, inheritance etc.";
